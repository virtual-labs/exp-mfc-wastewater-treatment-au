### Learning Objectives

1. To learn about the operational mechanisms of a double-chambered Microbial Fuel cell (MFC) in Wastewater Treatment.

2. To understand the principles of Microbial Metabolism, Electron transfer processes and Biofilm formation.

3. To learn about the essential parameters (electrode material, strength of microbial community and system design) that influence the efficiency of a Microbial Fuel Cell in wastewater Treatment.

4. To understand the eco-sustainability aspects of MFC technology integration into wastewater treatment processes and its potential to reduce environmental impacts by enhancing renewable resource recovery.
